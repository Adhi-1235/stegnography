Image Steganography Using LSB Technique
A simple Python-based steganography project that hides a secret message and passcode in an image using Least-Significant-Bit (LSB) encoding, and later retrieves the message securely.

Overview
This project uses robust LSB steganography to embed a secret message along with a passcode into an image. It consists of two Python scripts with user-friendly GUIs built using Tkinter.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Tkinter (usually included with Python)

Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries:
